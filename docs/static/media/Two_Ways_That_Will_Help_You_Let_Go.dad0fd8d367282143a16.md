This might be one of the most important and powerful lessons in life; letting go.

We have one of the harshest psychological set-ups of constantly self sabotaging ourselves. It’s practically involuntary.
And this, without realising, can provide us with most of our daily suffering.

That suffering of “I’m not good enough” voice going round and round in our heads. This is where the importance of self
acceptance plays a crucial role.

Self acceptance of who you are, who you have been and who you are going to become are all skills that can be developed
yet difficult to obtain.

We like to always avert back to comparing ourselves with others to allow ourselves to fall back into default “I’m not
good enough” mode.

If you thank your self suffering ego for their input and then disregard it, you’ll already start to accept yourself more
easily.

Second of all, letting go applies to the world around us. The chaos and games that continually exist and are pushed upon
us day to day can be tough to escape from.

There is an element of helplessness to it akin to never being able to win. Rather than def acceptance, this one just
requires acceptance.

Acceptance of the world, acceptance of others, acceptance of evil. Letting go.

This is a classic case of the uncontrollables. Way easier said than done and applying it is one of the toughest things
to master in life.

It’s important to acknowledge that it’s okay if you don’t manage to be this way all the time.

One of my best and most helpful suggestions would be to create an environment you desire; one that is self-loving and
accepting of everything. Remove that and those that are not. One that eliminates chaos day to day and appreciates the
wonders of calm and peace.

It may seem boring but is it suffering? Or a better question here is whether this is the right kind of suffering?

So letting go is wonderfully difficult and requires high levels of discipline. A skill many humans will never even get
close to mastering within and out with. What can you let go of today that will improve your life?
