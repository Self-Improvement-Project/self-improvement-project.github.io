“Gratitude turns what we have into enough.” – Unknown

Timing is obviously always important as well as overuse, but gratitude can be one of the closest things humans have to a
superpower.

21st century living conditions on average across the globe are the highest they have ever been. Which gives us more
reason to use gratitude when we’re acting spoilt.

This could potentially be a bigger rabbit hole into mental health problems we face with our modern lifestyle, but that’s
for another time.

As of writing, there are 2 ends of the gratitude scale I like to think of: From bratty to despondent.

As touched on above, being a brat can be a pretty quick realisation when being grateful comes into the picture. You have
unlimited internet access to as much entertainment as you want, all your basic needs are met. Yet you want more and are
unhappy about that. Pretty funny, huh?

The other end is the despondency. Another way of looking at it is from a nihilistic perspective; When we feel helpless
about all the bad in the world knowing we can’t change it all.

You may ask yourself questions such as “How can I be happy when I know there are children starving in the world?”

It can be a tough one to overcome and our brains are not programmed to keep up the intensity of that thought for long
periods of time. So time is one of the cures for this feeling.

So why am I talking about these 2 extremes? Because for the majority of the time, there is the part when you’re in the
middle and there is the opportunity to use of gratitude so to bring pleasure and peace.

From experience, gratitude is grounding. It is soothing. It’s like a hug telling you that you’ll be fine but also that
you’re enough.

Writing down things you are grateful for is crucial for it to sink in and bring meaning. The simplest things are the
most powerful. Your health for instance. Thoughts are fleeting and disappear forever. Writing takes effort (which brings
more value to your words) and can be revisited forever.

The time to collect the pen and paper. The time taken to think. The time taken to write the word down. Then that turning
into a more meaningful reflection and ultimate appreciation. It all adds up. In comparison to that fleeting thought.

One reason I say gratitude is a superpower is due to the fact that you will never lose the ability to demonstrate it.
You could be in the worst place of your life and show it. You could be 99 years old and show it. You could be caught up
with the busyness of life and in one second you can remember about the power of gratitude on your life.

To summarise, it’s ultimately a power you have to bring you closer to being present. No matter how high or low you are.
No matter how spoilt or angry you are. You can always rely on being more thankful to bring you peace.
