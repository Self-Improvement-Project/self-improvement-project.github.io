A lot of our demons come from a desire to keep up and fit in.

‘We’re not where we should be at this stage of life’

‘I wish I was more popular’

And these fallacies are ultimately our downfall in order to live a fulfilling and gratifying existence.

To live a good and meaningful life, we are taught to do only one thing: achieve.

Well today, I want to debunk that ever so slightly with achievement’s biggest enemy: existing.

Existing is underrated. Zero pressure, full acceptance, reduced ego, more meaning, the list goes on. And that’s just the
internal benefits!

On the contrary, do these benefits exist when as humans we are ‘naturally designed’ to strive for achievement. Surely
these things are the holy grail.

Yet how are we as a species full of depression, anxiety, dependence on medication and addiction to just survive day to
day?

Look, I’m not saying achievement is futile. Far from it. But should it be the nucleus of us and our lives? I believe
it should be more of a choice.

Think of the egomaniacs that rule the world. Politicians to tech giants. Household names. And this is the problem.
Achievement is certainly the focal point of their lives. Not ours. Yet they are the example of successful lives.

There are billions of us on earth who shouldn’t live their life this way. Yet we all try to.

You may argue money leaves us no choice but how much do you consume or are obsessed with ‘keeping up’?

That’s a mindset and a choice.

It may take a while to adjust and pivot away from it but it is certainly within control and reach.

So ask yourself the question, what would life be like if I chose to ‘just exist’?

To take a simple job that you enjoy but gives you enough time for meaningful activities in the rest of your time.

To have time to walk, read, study, write, meditate or exercise… for pleasure.

I was definitely guilty of achievement chasing in my twenties. And for what? To only realise that for some of us, zero
ego and full existence embracement is a better choice instead.
