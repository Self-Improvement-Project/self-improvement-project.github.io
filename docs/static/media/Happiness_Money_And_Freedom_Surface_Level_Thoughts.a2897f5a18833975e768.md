Happiness money and freedom.

We only gain happiness by removing the obstacles of money and freedom.

Let’s start basic – money solves money related happiness problems.

Freedom solves imprisoned happiness problems.

Once you have both, what makes us happy?

Those who have money way beyond their means are well known for just resetting their happiness threshold. But it’s the
lack of meaning that drives true sadness.

The simple question of “If I have this much money, why am I still unhappy?“

It is common knowledge that those who have too much freedom without structure or purpose are deeply unsatisfied as they
have nothing to strive for. Think of retirees, a lot of them end up going back to work because we’re not designed to do
nothing.

So I guess where this piece is leading to is more around true happiness once we’ve achieved everything we ever wanted.

This begs the question of “are we truly scared of it?” Perhaps because we don’t want to spend this time with ourselves
in our own thoughts. Everything in your life has been driven, and now you’re just expected to stop?

We may never settle for what we have because we know there is always more out there we can achieve. We will not be truly
satisfied until we reach that. Whatever ‘that’ is.

Or is it a case of the deadly psychological disease called ‘The Joneses’? There will always be someone out there who is
richer than you. Freer than you. And ultimately happier than you.

And this all comes from our innate evolution as a species where we have an unrelenting desire to be liked. Why do you
think nowadays everything on social media is called a ‘like’ or ‘love’ button.

We are programmed to need to validation from others about who we are.

It used to be that you would be killed or socially ousted if you didn’t reach the mark.

Now it’s just downright insanity trying to impress everyone. Even though a lot of those people we never cross paths with
again for the rest of our lives.

What more should I say about this topic? These are just my initial thoughts. Comment below and I’ll keep building this
piece.
