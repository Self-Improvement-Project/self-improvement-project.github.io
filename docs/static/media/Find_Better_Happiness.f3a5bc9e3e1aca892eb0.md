As we know, happiness isn’t material. It doesn’t come from goods. You’ll have heard in recent years the cliches of
‘creating memories’ and spending money on experiences as opposed to things. None of this is wrong, but I think there is
a deeper level to all this in the day to day of how we ought to live.

Let’s be honest, we all want to be happier. And it’s pretty wild that there is a yet to be discovered law of happiness.
There is great work into it
by [Meik Wiking of ‘The Happiness Research Institute’](https://www.happinessresearchinstitute.com/) and [Andy Cope,
the Doctor of Happiness](https://www.artofbrilliance.co.uk/), but how come it’s not universal? Are we just too rubbish
at
discovering it or are we as humans too genetically different to have simply one law to rule us all?

This is why I say ‘better’ rather than ‘true’ happiness. Because what defines happiness for me, may be different for
you. I feel the things I share on my podcast are less mainstream and more introspective. Not that either are right nor
wrong. But how about this question for you: What is better happiness for you?

What phase of life are you in? Timing is a huge factor for this question on happiness. Going out, drinking and partying
with your friends might make you happy as a teenager or young adult but not as a parent of three.

So assess your ‘better’. You might be working hard towards it and just need to tweak a few things whilst sticking to
your values. Or you may need a complete overhaul of your lifestyle and priorities to embrace the reak things that matter
to you.

Stop playing everyones elses games and figure out your own happiness. Like I said earlier, everyone is trying to be
happier. Not just you. So copying them won’t help you.

Start with 3 areas to guide you there:

1. Gratitude. What are you truly grateful for in your life? Do you spend enough time doing or being with that thing?
2. Are you looking after yourself? Your health, body and mind. Do you have enough ‘you’ time? Are you exercising and
   sleeping enough? Are you giving too much of yourself to others?
3. Are you truly living? Are you learning new things and challenging yourself enough? Are you travelling to new places
   you’ve never been before and experiencing something new? Are you mixing up your routine? Are you mastering hobbies
   and
   skills that will help you evolve as an individual?

These things feed ‘better’ happiness but not ‘true’ happiness. True happiness, my friends, is a myth. As Mark Manson so
eloquently put it in his book ‘Everything is F*cked‘: we always end up feeling 7/10 anyway.
