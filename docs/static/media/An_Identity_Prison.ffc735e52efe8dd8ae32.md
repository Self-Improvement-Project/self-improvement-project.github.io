Here’s one to whet your appetite before tomorrows workshop.

More likely than not, you are imprisoned.

Imprisoned by society. Imprisoned by the Joneses. And imprisoned by yourself.

But from the outside it doesn’t look that way.

You have a nice job. You have friends and an active social life. You have everything together and it’s all fine.

But this is all appearance and a narrative.

A narrative created, and that he existed since early in your life, to fit in.

These beliefs and appearances that everyone in your world knows you for simply exist. And you’re supposed to be okay
with that. Supposed to live alongside them and never change.

And this is the problem with the clichéd response when you see someone for the first time in a while and they say
‘you’ve changed’.

When in fact, the opposite is the true concern.

As the title suggests, we become accustomed to living up to the identity expected of us.

So not to upset anyone or disrupt the system.

Where is the freedom for mixing everything about you that is unique yet evolving?!

Some of this doubt to break free comes from social isolation.

“Will people still accept me if I change?”

“Will people still like me if I change?”

“Will I offend anyone?”

And look, some people like the identity games. Those who are driven and motivated by status want this.

But this is not the only game.

Psychologically, this seems to be the dominant game. Therefore it is the one that gets the most attention.

But that’s why you’re reading this. You want change. You want to know it’s okay.

And I’m here to tell you that it is.

If you’re going to truly live, you have to give in to change. To embrace the adventure of it and, without sounding
fluffy, follow your heart.

To put it simply, I like to ask 2 questions to discover the true gap between who you are currently and who you want to
become.

1. How would you describe yourself to someone you met for the first time today?

2. What do you wish you could say but is missing because you’re scared to commit to?

It’s sound simple but it’s difficult.

Your life narrative is controlled way more than you think and it takes a lot of energy to overcome it now and
permanently.

But that changes today. Embrace your beliefs and your dreams to create the identity you could die tomorrow with being
proud of.
