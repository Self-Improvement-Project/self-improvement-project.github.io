This is a very subjective question.

The stage in life you’re at will influence this hugely.

And what things come under the bracket of ‘quality’ anyway?

Knowing what you want is a good place to start.

A lot of people think they’ll like the idea of something.

Not working.

Going on lots of holidays or travel all the time.

Having ultimate freedom to do what they want when they want.

These are all ideas because for most they are a pipe dream.

They’re all possible. But not with the lifestyle you have. The distance between those two realities are vast. Which
makes them ideas.

Let’s be honest here. There is work out there you probably like and it gives you meaning. Maybe not within the tasks but
to your identity.

Working on something, apologies for the cliché, can give us purpose. Serving something beyond ourselves.

Not working leaves us depressed because we aren’t contributing to the world. It makes our existence feel futile.

Or let’s say you want to travel more? Digital nomading is more popular than ever. BUT remember the grass is always
greener.

Do you currently have a roof over your head without having to think about where you’re going to stay next?

Do you have a regular routine that allows you to focus on important things?

Do you have the comfort of your own space that is never interrupted?

I can imagine these are some of the things digital nomads may pine for time to time.

But let’s become balanced again. Purely from your own perspective, what does quality of life mean to you?

Do you need more stimulation or do you need more peace?

Like I mentioned at the beginning. Timing is a fine thing.

As you get more experience in life, your values change and evolve. This can be easily influenced by others (online and
offline). Don’t believe the too good to be true stories. There’s always something missing in someone’s life.

But increasing your quality of life can mean optimising the things readily available to you.

What amazing outdoor space is nearby that you could prioritise visiting more often for your soul?

Who have you not talked to or reached out to in a while that would improve your day?

Start simple with what you can today. Then keep analysing what you really want.
