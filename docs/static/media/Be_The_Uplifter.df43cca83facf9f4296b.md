Most of the online advice gurus say we have to be the best. Thee person to know and go to. And this has not sat well
with me for a while.

Number one from a values point of view; Success is subjective to many people. Unhealthy and uncontrollable (if not
manipulative) pressure to become some sort of version of success is the only option. Despite so many things in life
depending on luck, you must make yourself miserable during the process.

Why? Look I get the joy pain brings in retrospective terms. It can be a bit sociopathic to smile and laugh during such
pains sometimes. However, there is good suffering and bad suffering.

Bad suffering comes from doing things we don’t choose nor want properly. We are brainwashed and marketed to decide we
suddenly want something that you’re life was in fact fine without before. A lot of this is related to money.

Good suffering comes from knowing your heading in the right direction. You just need to do the hard miles to get there.
You know when you get any taste of success that it will be sweet and 100% pure.

I believe bad suffering comes from the sale of shortcuts. Be honest and think of any time you took a shortcut and you
taking any pure satisfaction out of it. This is where imposter syndrome SHOULD come from.

Do not confuse shortcuts with efficiency and effectiveness. Frustration comes from looking back and thinking you could
have been smarter, not quicker.

But is that not the whole point? Woah, big full circle moment. Is that frustration the good suffering?

ANYWAY, back to the title of this piece.

Be the uplifter. Why has that got anything to do with the above statements?

By being a success, you’re the main man. The number one person to go to. But, hear me out on this, what if that wasn’t
you being authentically effective.

We could get into how money won’t bring you that satisfaction long term, but that’s for another time.

How about we focus on your sole purpose to actually be to lift others up from the shadows.

I think this might be what I need to hear as well.

We’re surrounded by people being in the spotlight that makes us feel like we should be too. Or that we are a failure if
not.

Give others the belief they need authentically. Purely. Genuinely.

They don’t need to reach 10k of anything to be a success. They need peace of mind and comfort with who they are to be a
success.

Celebrate them achieving mastery that no one on else can do themselves.

Congratulate them on finding someone or something to serve that they’ve been missing their whole life up til now.

Give them credit on doing the hard miles to find a purpose they believe in continuing to develop for the rest of their
life.

Be the uplifter, not the showman.
