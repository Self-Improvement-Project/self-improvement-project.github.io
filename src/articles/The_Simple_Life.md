How many of you feel obliged to keep up with social expectations as opposed to simplifying your life?

Keeping up and displaying social norms is a part of every day life.

Behave a certain way. Have similar goals and desires. Be loud and busy socially.

And if not adhered to, we have the risk of being isolated.

But today is a vote for simplicity.

Valuing the importance of stripping back life.

No rush. No unnecessary expenditure.

A lot of implementation of simplicity comes from complete inner peace.

No qualms about any expectations that may exist because you are so at peace with who you are and what you want.

Having the peace of mind that regardless of how you act, you know you are doing the right thing for your well-being and
mental state.

These can be small decisions yet also big decisions.

A small decision may be deciding not to go to that big party on Saturday night that everyone is going to because you are
tired after a long week of work and family commitments.

A big decision might be taking a very simple job that will afford you time and space to enjoy the time you have outside
of work. Less stress equals more simplicity.

Modern life requires a lot of escapism. However this is always temporary. Sadly and perhaps cynically, this exists
because we barely have enough time to realise how full on our lives truly are therefore never escape the hamster wheel
of a busy life.

Escapism is our go to coping mechanism. But what if we looked at simplicity as our long term escapism plan. Resisting
more. More responsibility. More popularity. More commitments.

Dream today about a life of less. What would it look like and how would it change your life?
