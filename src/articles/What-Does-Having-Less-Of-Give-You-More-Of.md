March 2020 – the world comes to a halt. First time in many of our lives that we have experienced this. The initial
intuitive responses of panic took hold and, to be honest, took at least a few months to even begin to fade away.

But as we adapted, something important happened. Something crucial that some of us may have lost since but it will be
easier than ever to reclaim it back. And that thing is ‘less’.

Less demands. Less stuff. Less plans. Yes, the movements of minimalism and essentialism are still as strong as ever and
a lifestyle choice. I’m not asking you to do that. All I’m asking is for you to consider the benefits that less brought
you during that time and maybe still does now.

For me, solitude has always been nice. But to have more of it than not seemed like a luxury somewhat. Time to think.
Time to ponder. Time to unlock creativity.

My lifestyle became amazingly simplistic. And these things tended to (and still do) bring me the most joy. Time to make
proper homemade coffee. A long dog walk. Meditation. Taking time to cook proper meals than stuff my face because I’m
hungry and need an immediate hit. The benefit of simplicity is the reduction of attention to time.

We live in an age of squeezing time and I feel we need to move closer towards eradicating it somewhat.

‘More’ is a dream we’re sold to and keep up with due to the Joneses. We never know anything else and partly that is down
to our lack of desire to find out.

But as you may be more aware of now, pleasure is finite and feelings of it always plateau based on your circumstance.

Do you think you could firstly force yourself to live with less? Go against the grain. Bear the judgement of others. And
secondly, do you think you could be happy with less?

One of the beauties of less is it heightens the experience of the small things. When you take time over drinking and
eating mindfully, it literally tastes better. Try it.

When you take time over a walk, the air smells fresher and the birds sing more harmoniously. Honestly.
