Hello everyone,

So Iâ€™m going back and starting to write out a lot of my podcast episodes because, hey, I love them, even almost 2 years
later. And sometimes, lots of podcast episodes can be overwhelming to catch up on. Everyone loves a nice read on a
boring commute too ðŸ™‚

Todayâ€™s writing is about one of the first episodes I ever did on the podcast back in May 2020. Itâ€™s all about living
with an infinite mindset. I first came across the concept through Simon Sinekâ€™s book on it, with the same title as this
piece.

A lot of us in today's world play finite games. We look for outcomes all the time. Measurableâ€™s. Legacies! Itâ€™s not our
fault. We are programmed to in this current society. If youâ€™re not winning, youâ€™re losing right? But this applies
unhealthy amounts of pressure on us to live and endless life of targets and goals. In order to look back on our life and
be happy with the outcomes weâ€™ve got? I donâ€™t think so.

This is where living an infinite mindset comes in. What if there was no end? No end to any of the tasks, games or life
you were living. If you want to be really blunt about it, none of what youâ€™re doing really matters anyway in the grand
scheme of things. The impact it will have on the world? Nada. But this isnâ€™t about existentialism. This is about how
freeing and liberating it is to view the world infinitely. It will benefit your mental health drastically.

Letâ€™s take an example everyone can relate to: fitness. None of us are as fit as we want to be. Maybe weâ€™re a bit lazier,
maybe weâ€™re injured, or maybe weâ€™re working towards a big goal and not there yet. On that point, what if I concluded
that
none of this matters? What if you had a free pass or clean slate for the rest of your life? Hey, if youâ€™re fat and lazy,
you know itâ€™ll burden your future self. So instead of trying to lose 5 stone in 6 months, why donâ€™t you try to be a
healthy person for the rest of your life. The peace of mind at the end of your life knowing that youâ€™ve turned yourself
around and probably increased the quality of your life since you made that decision.

These lines may seem blurred but try to remove any finite goals from your mind that exist in your life today. How does
it make you feel? Do they really matter? What if you flipped any of these goals into infinite goals?

The last point Iâ€™ll leave you with is how an infinite mindset impacts upon our identity. We become prouder of who we
are. We stop living our lives through a comparison lens. We arenâ€™t living to survive and strive, weâ€™re living it to last
forever and enjoy the things that make us happy.

So some questions to finish. Where are you going with your life? Are you living with a finish line? How are you going to
change your mindset to impact on your identity and therefore become proud of who you are?
