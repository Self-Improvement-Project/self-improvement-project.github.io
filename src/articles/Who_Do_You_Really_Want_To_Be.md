I’ve realised I don’t use this platform to tell you what to do, I use it to help you think more clearly.

So today, we’re going to look at a few questions that will help us get there a bit quicker.

I’ve done podcast episodes before about what you really want but this is all about who you are today. All about our
identity and creating that bit by bit.

It can be tough to break the mould, perhaps when you’ve been living a type of life for so long.

But now, it’s quite easy to say that people change and evolve over time. It’s naive to ignore this.

The important question here is how do we do it? How do you jump in without any consequences?

Firstly you can’t. It’s like ying yang. You can’t give up something for something better without facing a backlash.

One of the biggest concerns is probably social exile. People are scared to break a mould they’re known for within their
circles. Afraid of what people may think or say about them. Here’s a hot take for you – they’ll only think it for a few
minutes (mainly to make themselves feel better about themselves) to then forget and go back to thinking about the most
important thing in the world – themselves.

But imagine living up to the expectations of others forever. Is that how you want to remember your life?

This is the classic no regrets cliché but there is genuinely no better time than now to change this.

What are you hiding or not committing to that would 10x your fulfilment in life?

Success and fulfilment are beautiful concepts because we have complete autonomy over what they mean to us.

We often let the world decide for us, but at one time or another, we opt to take control positively about trying things
we want to and letting it evolve and mould into this new version of ourselves.

Yet sometimes we refuse to jump.

This is the time to be selfish. You’ll be accepted by those you’re supposed to and if not, then leave them behind.

So let’s summarise some big questions today –

How do we jump in with both feet into a new version of ourselves?

What are we not doing right now that would 10x our life out of fear? Note, the fear is probably validation.

And lastly, who do you really want to be?
