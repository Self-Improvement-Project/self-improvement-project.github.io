Self reflection is a long term benefit.

There is no external gratification. There is no dopamine hit.

I would compare the feeling to gratitude, appreciation or meditation. It’s like flipping any negative thoughts or mental
baggage into a learning process. Instead of the ‘why is this happening to me’ we’re flipping our mindset to ‘what is
this trying to teach me’.

It has to be triggered though. Don’t fool yourself into thinking this is an automatic response, or you can programme
your mind. Your chimp takes over. Read more about your chimp in ‘The Chimp Paradox’ by Prof. Steve Peters. What we need
to work on, is our systems, prioritising that time each day to self reflect. Experiment here, you need find what works
for you. And now I’m going to touch on the when and the how.

When you self reflect is unique to you. Morning, afternoon or evening. On your commute, a walk or when having a coffee.
You need a trigger and by identifying when you want to self reflect will help you pick and choose.

Next is the how.

Firstly, how we self reflect can be very important. I personally feel there are 3 ways.

First, meditating. Meditation, as I’ve talked about on a previous podcast episode, is very good for decluttering our
minds. Removing any mental baggage and allowing us to go deeper into what’s important. Blocking out time in the day,
even 10 minutes, is crucial here. Use the triggers above to help you identify. Do your best to ensure you can’t get
interrupted too.

Secondly, conversations with others. Those we trust and respect. Family, friends or spouses. By doing so we can gain
advice or learn from mistakes they’ve maybe gone through with experience. Their energy can lead you to options and
thoughts you may not have been able to come up with on your own.

And thirdly, which in my perspective, is the easiest to implement as a habit and get the most satisfaction of, is
writing. Use a journal or diary. It is the easiest as you don’t need to rely on anyone. All you need is pen and paper.
Crucially, I feel physically writing is important to success. You are literally spilling your thoughts via the physical
connection of the pen. This truly allows it to sink in. Not even typing can do that.

My last point here is that journaling is the most satisfying. This is because in years to come you can look back with
pride of what you’ve achieved. Maybe look at the hardship you overcame or the happy times you were embracing. There is a
virtue here that cannot be gained through anything else. So enjoy that.

And that’s it. I hope you’ve found that useful, and you feel you can take action from that. If you enjoyed this, share
with others who you think would like it or benefit from it. Thanks.
