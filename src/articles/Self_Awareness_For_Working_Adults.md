I’ve got it! All this nonsense I spit every day is mostly applicable for… working adults.

Why?

Because we aren’t taught how to live as a working adult in any formal education setting.

We let our emotions override us. Let the systems decide how we should be. And most importantly, become prisoners to our
own thoughts.

I’ve recently been reading the wonderful ‘I may be wrong’ by Björn Natthiko Lindeblad and two things strike me so far:

1. accept everyone for who they are, it makes everyone’s lives more pleasant and enjoyable.

2. We are not our thoughts. We spend our lives living through them until the moment we realise we don’t have to.

Your thoughts are just a perception of life itself. A perception of the world that everything up until now, your mind
has decided is true.

But what if you were to remove ‘you’ from ‘your thoughts’?

Detachment to some extent.

When we decide on a view, we feel obliged to stick by it as it is some form of representation of ourselves. What if it
wasn’t?

What if that perception just existed. Zero judgement nor association. It creates a form of mental freedom. A liberation
of your current existence. And the courage to move forward as an individual. Progression of one’s self.

So why am I telling you this today? Is it permission? Maybe. Is it opportunity? Most definitely. Or maybe it is a choice
for you that you are now aware of.

Being aware of the prison we may be a part of is the first step forward.

It is beyond any temporary self-care habit or revolutionary trend.

This is liberation front the mind and the world that your mind is currently a part of. Move beyond the surface of this
entrapment to start truly living.

Something is humans could get a whole lot better at.
