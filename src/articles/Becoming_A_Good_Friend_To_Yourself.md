We can torture ourselves with the following:

Self doubt

Imposter syndrome

Self criticism

And this cycle is continuous if we don’t step in and stop it.

There will be the usual highs and lows in life, these will never not exist. However, those 3 things I just referred to
should be a rarity, not a constant.

Think of something in the last few days that has brought up any of those particular feelings. Then take a step back and
think how insignificant was that thing.

It’s always less than you originally thought.

So why do we put ourselves through this nonsensical pain?

Perhaps it’s a lack of control. We don’t know how to stop it. You can’t control your mind fully, but there are certainly
ways to train it to prevent things as insignificant as this.

Or maybe we have normalised it. We deserve it. It’s necessary in order to move forward. Look, there will be times in the
future where you will be humbled. Yet it will bring a strange sense of hope and satisfaction that you’re on the right
track. It shouldn’t continually stress us out about not being capable enough.

So how do we avert this?

I believe we need to be a better friend to ourselves. We need to encourage. We need to look at it from a third person
perspective and think ‘good effort’.

We need to appreciate that whatever has happened hasn’t aligned with us or our values. And that is okay, because we are
closer to finding out what is.

We, as a species, are not designed to lie down and let life happen to us. We are the most innovative and progressive
species to have existed.

So the next time you try and fail, be that good friend to yourself.

That next time you take a break to rest and recuperate, be that good friend to yourself.

And remember that life will happen to you, don’t let your mind get in your own way.
