Covid has given me time to reflect.

I’ve always been quite chilled and zen however depending on your influences and environment this can change.

I want to talk to you about the benefits of slowing down in a fast moving world.

Firstly, happiness is not a quick hit gratification thing anymore. We know that. Having a simple conversation with a
good friend is better than 100 likes on Facebook.

Cooking a fresh meal from scratch is more satisfying than getting a meal from McDonald's.

When compared against one another.

So when we compare, the main reason we get food from McDonald’s or post on Facebook is speed.

Speed of happiness. Which then leads to a truly vicious spiral months down the line.

So I want to challenge your thinking, to try implementing ways to slow down. And enjoy the short time you have on the
earth. And not let it fly by for no substantial reason.

Perception and unlearning – most people in the western world have been brought up in a fast-paced world. Corporate,
growth is the only thing that matters regardless of anything else.

And we hop on. Without thinking any differently. Our minds consumed with endless tasks that have to be completed by the
end of the day, which has meant you’ve already missed lunch and then before you know it, years have passed you by. And
you still can’t remember what you’ve achieved and what it was for. But then it gets worse.

In years to come, It gets to the point where you can’t remember what that work call or meeting was about when you missed
a family birthday.

Because at the end of the day, and sometimes when we realise it’s too late, there are only a few things that matter.
Like family and friends.

A lovely quote I heard from Mark Manson was – ‘some of the most extraordinary things in life are the most ordinary.
Spending time with family, walking the dog, reading, having a laugh. And it’s because these things are what bring us
wholesomeness and fulfilment each and every day.

Ever since we are in primary school, social status is the most important thing as a kid. And that’s why we’re programmed
the way we are. I challenge you to unlearn that. And take time to self reflect to understand what truly matters to you.
Because I can guarantee you that it’s likely ‘status’ is not top of your list. Social status, job status, financial
status. All of these serve our ego, but don’t make us feel truly fulfilled.

Once you take the time to understand yourself, you’ll appreciate how slowing down can make your life so much better.

Spending more time with your partner or talking to friends, finding a better job, doing more self education and feeding
your curiosity.

And ultimately this leads to self actualisation. Getting closer to the person you want to become. But also respecting
that there isn’t an end goal.
